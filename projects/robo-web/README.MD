#ROBO-WEB

That is a project made for a job challenge.

The challenge was make it possible to communicate via REST with a robot located in Mars.
The robot is inside a field with 5x5 cubes of area.
It can move forward, turn left and turn right, to do that it gets these respective commands (M,L,R).
The robot moves only one step for M command.
When the robot receives the commands it must return its location, the x position, the y position and its relative location.
